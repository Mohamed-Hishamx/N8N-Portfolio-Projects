📌 Project Notes
Automated Sales Performance Alert (n8n)
Project Overview

This project is an automated sales monitoring and alert system built using n8n, designed to help sales and management teams track daily performance and receive instant alerts when sales fall below a defined threshold.

The workflow runs on a schedule, analyzes sales data from Google Sheets, and automatically notifies stakeholders via Telegram if performance issues are detected.

🎯 Objectives

Monitor daily sales performance automatically

Detect underperformance without manual checks

Provide real-time alerts to decision-makers

Improve response time to declining sales trends

Reduce dependency on manual reporting

⏰ Trigger & Scheduling

Schedule Trigger runs the workflow daily at 18:00

Ensures consistent end-of-day performance evaluation

Fully automated, no manual intervention required

📊 Data Source

Google Sheets used as the sales data source

Workflow reads all rows from a specified sheet

Sales data includes categories and sales values

🧮 Data Processing Logic

JavaScript code aggregates sales data

Filters sales by Technology category

Calculates total Technology sales for the day

Outputs a single summarized result for evaluation

🔍 Business Rules & Conditions

A predefined sales threshold is applied:

Alert condition: Total Technology Sales < $50,000

Conditional logic determines whether an alert is required

Prevents unnecessary notifications when performance is healthy

🚨 Alerts & Notifications

When the sales threshold is not met:

A Telegram alert is sent automatically

Message includes:

Total Technology sales value

Clear warning indicator

Action prompt to review performance

This enables fast decision-making and immediate corrective action.

📱 Notification Channel

Telegram Bot used for real-time alerts

Ideal for mobile-first monitoring

Ensures alerts are seen quickly by managers and sales teams
